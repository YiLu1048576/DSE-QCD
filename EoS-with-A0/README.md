# EoS-with-A0
Data repository for QCD equation of state, computed by the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) approach with gluonic background field (A0), see [arXiv: 2504.05099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099). 

Currently we provide two types of data format for convenience of usage: 

1) the data with equal steps of T from 100 to 245 MeV, and muB from 0 to 600 MeV, which are put in the main folder.

2) the data with equal steps of T from 100 to 245 MeV, and muB/T from 0 to 4.0, which are stored in the const-muB-over-T folder. They are in match with Fig. 8-10 in our paper.
